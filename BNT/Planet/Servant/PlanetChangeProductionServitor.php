/*
 * NOTES on what this function does and how
 * 
 * We need to track what the player_id is and what corp they belong to if they belong to a corp,
 *   these two values are not passed in as arrays
 *   ship_id = the owner of the planet          ($ship_id = $prodpercentarray[ship_id])
 *   team_id = the corperation creators ship_id ($team_id = $prodpercentarray[team_id])
 * 
 * First we generate a list of values based on the commodity
 *   (ore, organics, goods, energy, fighters, torps, corp, team, sells)
 * 
 * Second we generate a second list of values based on the planet_id
 * Because team and ship_id are not arrays we do not pass them through the second list command.
 * When we write the ore production percent we also clear the selling and corp values out of the db
 * When we pass through the corp array we set the value to $team we grabbed out of the array.
 * in the sells and corp the prodpercent = the planet_id.
 * 
 * We run through the database checking to see if any planet production is greater than 100, or possibly negative
 *   if so we set the planet to the default values and report it to the player.
 * 
 * There has got to be a better way, but at this time I am not sure how to do it.
 * Off the top of my head if we could sort the data passed in, in order of planets we could check before we do the writes
 *   This would save us from having to run through the database a second time checking our work.
 * 
 * 
 * This should patch the game from being hack with planet Hack.
